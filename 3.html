            The more I deal with the work as something that is my own, as
            something that is personal, the more successful it is.

        Art directors are responsible for overseeing the care of valuable art
        pieces within a collection. This role also requires managing staff to
        ensure the proper care for different pieces of art, as well as ensuring
        strict guidelines exist that help determine how each piece of art is
        handled. Art directors regularly plan and organize new exhibitions, and
        work to procure new artwork for display within a museum, art gallery, or
        public and private space. Advancement into this position often follows
        successful years of service within an art gallery or museum, as well as
        through proven work in art and art history.
